uuid-freebsd
============

UUID generation for PostgreSQL on FreeBSD

License: distributed under the same terms as PostgreSQL itself. (BSD license)

Installation: just do gmake install

This version supports the CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-freebsd"; method of
installing, and therefore requires PG 9.1. If you want one that
installs on older PG, try version 1.03 of this package.
